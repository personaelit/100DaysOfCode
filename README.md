#100DaysOfCode

Day 1: Doing the thing. First project is to create a basic utility app (calculator) using TDD.

Day 2: TDD is both frustrating and fun.

Day 3: Didn't write a single line, but thought a lot. There are some cool libraries that I could use to evaluate strings as mathematical expressions.  After deliberation and experimentation, I decided that this is just a fun project with no real reason for being, so I can, in fact, re-invent the wheel. Meaning, not going to use the libraries and will follow the KISS axiom.

Day 4: Really got into TDD. Forgot to commit.

Day 5: It's a Friday and I'm tired but I did it.

Day 6: Great night - programmed with O.

Day 7: Phoned it in a bit. Superbowl Sunday.

Day 8: TDD is hard but oh so good. Working with interfaces. 

Day 9: TDD is ready to find bugs before you write them.  

Day 10: 10 Days straight!!!

Day 11: Finished up Calc as much as is needed.

Day 12: ConsoleExpressions

Day 13: Rudimentary Battleship Style Console Game POC

Day 14: Backed off the game until I build a library of effects.

Day 15: Started TDD again, which slows things down in the immediate, but pays off later. I have questions about an appropriate way to test a console app.

Day 16: I'm tired.  

Day 17: Switched to site generator project.
